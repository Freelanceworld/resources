Scan Statistics

One of the reasons why marketers are turning to dynamic QR codes is their trackability. Unlike static QR codes, dynamic QR redirect users to a webpage when scanned. Therefore, it’s possible to collect various metrics and compile them in visual formats.
Why QR Code Scan Statistics Are Important
If you generate a dynamic QR code on ScanMeFindMe Pro, you’ll be able to track key metrics that help in your marketing effort.

Rather than merely distributing marketing materials with QR codes, you’ll want to monitor engagement indicators like how many people are accessing a landing page via QR code. Or if a particular campaign is reaching its audience in major cities.

Without dynamic QR codes, you will have no idea if you’re reaching the target audience or on the right track with conversion goals. You’ll need to gather relevant statistics from dynamic QR codes and use them to improvise the campaign.

QR code statistics show you what’s working on your campaign and what’s not. You’ll know if you need a more intriguing design or a revamp in the overall strategy for better conversion from the numbers and charts.
Which Scan Statistics Are Available On ScanMeFindMe PRO?
ScanMeFindMe is developed to track and store important scan metrics in real-time. You’ll have access to the following statistics when you sign up for a PRO account.

Total Scans

This chart shows you the number of total and unique scans that you’re getting daily.
Unique scans are the number of scans done from different devices. It does not include multiple scans from the same device.

We use a special method where our server tags a device with a ‘fingerprint’ when it first scans a QR code. If the server detects a new scan with the same ‘fingerprint’, it is added to the total scans but not the unique scans.

You’ll find this chart helpful when you want to know how many people are actually responding to your campaign. The unique scans will paint a clearer picture of how your campaign fared.
Scans By Months



If you’re running a seasonal campaign, this chart will be helpful. The numbers of scans are plotted according to months. It helps you to identify months that bring you the most QR code traffic.

Scans By Hours Of The Day

You can also track QR scans by hours of the day. This is useful if you’re running a restaurant or e-commerce where customers peak during different times. It helps you to run a more targeted campaign during the peak hours.

Scans By OS

Our server could also pick up which operating system the users are using when scanning the QR code. Usually, iOS and Android tend to dominate the chart as most users scan QR codes from their mobile phones. The statistics help when you’re getting users to download an app for a specific OS.

Scans By Language


If you’re targeting English-speaking audience, you’ll naturally want scans originating from people fluent in English. This chart shows the breakdown of the scans by language.
Scans By Country and City


ScanMeFindMe PRO also tracks scans by city and country. This is done from tracking the IP address of the mobile operator or internet service provider where the device is connected to. Do note that the geolocation chart only gives an approximate location of where the scans originated.
Last Scans


This table is populated with historical scan data. You’ll find the finer details of each scan such as the date, time, country, language, OS and browser.
How To View And Download The Scan Statistics?
All ScanMeFindMe PRO users have access to the statistics, which are displayed on the dashboard. You can also access the charts and tables via the ‘Statistics’ button on each of the dynamic codes.



The Last Scans table can be downloaded in .csv format, which can be used for in-depth analysis.

<h2>Geolocation</h2>

<p>City and country information are resolved from the IP address. IP address belongs to the Internet Service Provider. When somebody scans the QR code on mobile phone with mobile data the city and country will be of the place where the mobile operator is registered, which may be far away from the actual physical location of the person.</p>

<h2>Identifying unique scans</h2>

<p>Every time somebody scans a dynamic code for the first time we assign them a random "fingerprint" and send to the server to track the view. Every next time the same person scans this or another dynamic code the same "fingerprint" is sent to the server. This allows us to see how many differenet people scanned a code and which codes are often scanned together by the same person</p>

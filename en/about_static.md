<h1>What information can be stored in QR codes</h1>

<p>QR codes have been around for many years but only recently “thanks” to Covid-19, everybody knows what they are and everybody knows that any smartphone camera can automatically detect and decode QR codes.</p>

<p>But QR codes are much more than just following a URL and opening a website in a browser. And just as well, every smartphone can open a contact, read WiFi credentials, start typing a message and offer to make a phone call.</p>

<p>It is important to mention that smartphones will not actually connect to WiFi, send a message or make a phone call automatically, they will first ask the user to confirm if this is what they want to do.</p>

<p>QR codes only provide the means to encode the text. Any text. However if this text starts with http:// or https:// the scanner will know that this is a URL and they should offer to open it in the browser. There are other patterns that smartphones will automatically look for in this text, for example, if the text starts with “tel:” the phone will offer to make a phone call; if text starts with “mailto:” or “smsto:” the phone will offer to send an email or an SMS. The phone will also automatically recognise business cards in vCard and meCard formats and calendar events. Some apps on your phone may also chime in and say “hey, I know this prefix, my app can handle it”, usually it will be wallets for online payments.</p>

<p>Finally, when your phone fails to recognise what the text inside QR code means, it will just offer you to copy it to the clipboard. </p>

<p>So what are the differences between static and dynamic QR codes and when you should use one or another?</p>

<p>Dynamic QR codes work the best:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you want to upload files</li>
    <li>When you want to be able to modify information at any moment without needing to print a new QR code</li>
    <li>When you only have a very long URL and it results in a very crumbled QR code that can be more difficult to scan (the shorter is the URL the smaller is the QR code matrix)</li>
    <li>When you need to monitor how many times the QR codes were scanned and from where</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever your use case is, the dynamic QR code can only be a URL (a page on the internet) and the person who scans it must be connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Static QR codes work the best:</p>
<ul>
    <li>WiFi credential. Obviously! You probably need them because you DON’T have internet yet</li>
    <li>Send SMS or make a phone call. Again, you don’t need the internet to make SMS or a call. In fact, such QR codes can only be static. Your phone will automatically recognise QR codes that have text starting with “tel:” or “smsto:”.</li>
    <li>Sending an email. Even though you do need the internet to actually send email, you can scan a QR code that contains an email and type the actual message while being offline. When the text in the QR code starts with “mailto:” your phone will know that it needs to open the mail application and create a new message.</li>
    <li>Text that you want to share with other people. The QR scanner (or phone camera) will just offer you to copy the text to the clipboard.</li>
    <li>Special commands that open a specific app on the phone (like calendar or crypto wallet)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Both dynamic and static QR can work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For storing contact information. Yes you can store your business card as static information. However you can do much more with dynamic QR codes here - you can add files and long details.  Also if the contact information is static, some phones will only offer to save it but would not show the details. This can scare some people away, especially if all they want is to call you, not save the details on their phone.</li>
    <li>Any social media links, like opening a Facebook profile, preparing a tweet, starting WhatsApp conversation, etc.  All these commands are basically URLs so you can use both static and dynamic QR codes for them. Use dynamic codes for updating information, tracking and/or short URLs, otherwise static and dynamic codes will have the same effect here.</li>
</ul>

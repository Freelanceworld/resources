Adding Logos to QR

The emergence of QR codes has transformed marketing. It encouraged customer engagement, makes information more accessible, and adds flexibility to marketing.

However, a little bit of personalization can go a long way in increasing brand exposure and awareness. Adding a logo to the QR code is a step towards getting more scans, leads, and conversions.
Why Should You Add Logos To QR Code?
Imagine printing plain QR codes onto leaflets, product packagings, banners, and other marketing materials. While the QR codes work perfectly, they did nothing to convey your brand identity.

In business, it’s important to increase awareness and instill brand loyalty amongst your customers. Logos are the most identifiable element that customers associate with a brand. You’ll want your QR code to stand out from those printed in the plain, default format.

Customer associate logos with the company. By adding it to the QR code, you instill trust amongst the customers, and they’ll have little hesitation about scanning it. If you’re using a plain QR code, people may question if scanning the QR code is safe.
Does Adding A Logo Affects QR Code Scanability?


QR codes store information in segments of dots and spaces within the scannable area. When you add a logo, it occupies an area that’s suppose to hold part of the encoded information.

The question is, will it affect the QR code’s integrity in any manner?

If you’re using ScanMeFindMe PRO to add the logo, there will not be any problem in scanning it. This is because QR code is built with an error-correcting mechanism. Depending on the error correction level, a QR code is still readable even with up to 30% of the area covered up.

Of course, you shouldn’t cover critical functional elements such as the QR markers and version identifier with the logo. It is, however, generally safe to add a logo in the middle of the QR code.

When you add a logo to a QR code, you need to set its error correction level to the maximum, which is 30%. Our QR code generator automatically does that for you and determines the best logo placement based on factors like QR code size and information density.

Use QR Codes To Share Files

Do you receive numerous calls from customers because they have trouble finding the right product manuals? Or are you tired of emailing multiple attachments to your team members?

Regardless of which business you’re in, there’s always room for improvement when it comes to information sharing. If the existing method proves to be a bottleneck, it’s time to re-evaluate if you’re using the right technology to share files.

Cloud storage is one part of the solution, but the key to efficient file-sharing is enabling recipients access to the resources with minimum fuss. That’s where using QR codes for file-sharing kicks in.
How Does File Sharing With QR Codes Work?
Unlike what most people imagined, you wouldn’t be storing the files into a QR code. Most files are too large to be encoded into a QR code.

Instead, the files are uploaded to a webpage, and a shortened URL is generated and stored in the QR code. When users scan the code, they are redirected to the webpage where they can download the files.


If you’re using ScanMeFindMe PRO, you can also include the title, description, and logo on the file-sharing page. It makes the page looks more professional and provides more information about the downloadable files to users.
Why Use QR Codes To Share File?
There are various ways to access information, but QR codes offer multiple advantages over conventional ones.
It’s Efficient
With QR Codes, you can consolidate different resources on a single webpage. It saves you the trouble of sorting out which files to be sent out and who are the right recipients.

All you need to do is to upload the files once and send out the QR codes. It spares you the trouble of waiting for the uploads to complete. Also, there’s a lesser chance of sending out the wrong files in an email.
It’s Economical
QR code file-sharing offers the best of two different digital technologies. You don’t have to invest in printing out stacks of documents, which leads to tremendous savings in print expenses.

You can add the QR code with minimum cost on product packaging, leaflets, banners, or emails and have users accessing the files digitally.
It’s Flexible
Did you have an updated version of the user manuals? Or keen to offer new recipes along with packs of pasta? You don’t have to scrap existing marketing materials printed with the QR code.

Being a dynamic QR code, you can remove and add new files on the webpage and retain the existing QR code.
It’s Trackable
If you’re just mailing out attachments, you can’t trace how many of them are downloaded by the recipients. With a dynamic QR code, you can track the number of scans and where they originated.

These statistics are helpful when you’re evaluating how customers are engaging with the product.

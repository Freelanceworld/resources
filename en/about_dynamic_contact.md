<h1>Use QR Codes To Share Contact Details</h1>


Share the company or person's contact information with detailed information and maybe even photo or logo. Place the QR code on business cards or information leaflets. Track how often it was scanned



ScanMeFindMe allows you to quickly create a page with the contact information of a person or an organisation. It can include the photo or logo, names, phone numbers, email, URL, links to various social networks profiles, address and notes. When clients scan this QR code they will be able to see all of this data and immediately contact you or save it to their phone contacts.

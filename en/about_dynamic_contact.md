<p>Besides, did you know that

    are thrown off within a week after they are handed out?</p>

<p>That's a staggering number of business cards gone to waste. Not only does it go against many companies' environmental commitment, but it also explains why some clients never reach out to you even when they promised to. </p>

<p>More business cards have a QR code printed on them so that people can easily save the contacts on smartphones and that should be part of your strategy. </p>
<h3> Why Use QR Codes For Sharing Contact Details? </h3>
<p>You need to make it easier for clients to save your contacts on their phones, but unfortunately, physical business cards aren't optimized for that.  </p>

<p>Busy professionals find it a hassle to browse through stacks of business cards to find the right contact unless they invest in a business card scanner. Still, there's a chance that some cards are misplaced or are already disposed of. </p>

<p><a href="#static:contact">Digitizing your contact details with QR codes</a>   addresses many of the disadvantages of using physical business cards.</p>

<p>All your clients have to do is scan the QR code and have all the contact information displayed on the screen.  </p>

<p>With a single button,   the  y can contact you straight away or store the information on the phone. It puts an end to instances where clients misplace or forget your emails or phone numbers. </p>
<h2> What Contact Information Can Be Stored In A QR Code </h2>
<p>It depends on which type of QR code you're using.</p>

<p>If you're using a static QR code, you can store basic details (such as name, phone, email, website, and address) on the QR code in
    <a href="#article:about_contactformats">Vcard or MeCard format</a>.
    When you scan a static QR code, you get to save the contact information on your smartphone. </p>

<p><a href="#article:about_static">Static QR codes</a> encode the information directly, limiting how much information you can store. You'll need to use a dynamic QR code to include additional information like a photo/logo or social media handles.  </p>

<p>Dynamic QR codes work differently from their static counterpart. Instead of encoding the contact details, it stores the information on a webpage and embeds a shortened URL in the QR Code.  </p>

<p>When users scan the code, they are redirected to the webpage that acts as a digital business card. The displayed contact details can be downloaded and saved onto a smartphone's contacts. </p>

What Are MeCard and Vcard formats

You’ve heard that QR codes make social networking easier. You can do away with stacks of printed business cards and have all your contact information encoded in a QR code.

Yet, there’s often a choice to be made when generating a QR code for contacts. Should you choose MeCard or the Vcard format?

For most people, terms like MeCard and Vcard are intimidatingly unfamiliar. But knowing the fundamental difference between both formats helps in making the right choice when printing QR codes for contacts.
MeCard vs Vcard
Both MeCard and Vcard are established standards in how personal details are stored in a QR code. Vcard is created in the 1990s and is the more popular of the two standards. Meanwhile, MeCard is developed by Domoco, the largest mobile phone service provider in Japan.

Vcard supports a wide range of applications, including mobile phones, QR codes, emails, websites, and SMS. However, MeCard is limited to QR codes and mobile phones.

Both formats support almost similar information, such as name, telephone, email, website, and address. The Vcard format supports organization and job title fields, which are not available in MeCard.

When rendered, you’ll get a smaller, compact QR code with the MeCard format. This means that a MeCard contact QR code is more readable when printed on a smaller area compared to its Vcard counterpart.


Which Is The Better Choice?
It depends on how you intend to use the QR code. MeCard offers simplicity, and you can print it easily on a business card. You don’t need an internet connection to scan and save the contact details into your phone book.

Vcard is used more extensively for sharing contacts and is superior in terms of the types of information stored. While Vcard can be stored as a static QR code, you’ll get much more out of it by using it as a dynamic QR code.

A dynamic QR code stores a link that redirects users to a web page to view and download the contact details in VCF format. You can also include photos and social media links when you’re using ScanMeFindMe PRO.

Also, a dynamic Vcard QR code is more compact because it stores the virtual card’s URL instead of the actual contacts. It’s also possible to track how many people have scanned and viewed your contacts with a dynamic Vcard.

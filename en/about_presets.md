Save time generating multiple QR codes




<p>Presets are a feature of ScanMeFindMe QR generator that allows you to quickly and efficiently generate many different QR codes with a similar style. Presets can be used in both web site generator and when using API.</p>

<p>ScanMeFindMe already comes with several presets that are also sometimes called “Design ideas”. </p>

<p>Preset is a collection of the style settings - style of the QR code, name of the template, logo, positioning of the logo, the template captions, colors, etc. Remember that presets only store names of the template or logo, not the actual contents. If you rename or remove them the preset will not be able to find them.</p>

<p>To create your own presets you need to use the PRO account. Try it in the free 14-day trial period.</p>

<p>1. When you generate any QR code press a button “Save as a new preset” that you can find on the top of the “Setup the style” section.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2. In your Library duplicate your own or shared preset and then edit it.</p>

<p>Each preset must have a name. You can change the names of the existing presets in your Library. You can use the name of the presets when you generate QR codes using API.</p>

Save Time By Creating Presets

Having a personalized QR code that captures customer’s attention helps in getting more engagement. With fun colors, a catchy caption, and a logo, you’ll have a QR code that resonates with your brand value.

Customizing QR codes can be a fun process, but it can be equally taxing if you do it every time you need to generate a QR code.

This is where you’ll want to create presets, a feature exclusive to ScanMeFindMe PRO users.
What Are Presets And Why Do You Need Them?
Presets are a memory of customization you’ve selected or created for a particular QR code. When you’re using ScanMeFindMe PRO, you get to personalize the QR code with style, colors, templates, and logos.

These selections can be saved as a preset where they can automatically be selected and applied to a new QR code. Technically, a preset contains information on the particular choices of styles, templates, logos, and colors. Presets are valid as long as the individual elements are not renamed or deleted.

Here’s how you can use presets to save setup time when creating a QR code.

You’re releasing a series of yoga tutorial videos, and you’re encoding the links in QR codes. If you’re to personalize the QR code for each episode, you’ll need to manually choose the colors, logo, templates, and style.

It’s easy to make a mistake, which results in some QR codes looking out of place. Also, you’re wasting time repeating a process that can be automated.

By saving your choices as a preset, you can reuse the style elements by just loading the same preset when generating the QR code for each episode.
How To Create And Save Presets
If you’re using ScanMeFindMe PRO, you can create a preset with the ‘Save as a Preset’ button on the QR code generator. You’ll need to assign a name to the preset before committing it to the system’s memory.


Alternatively, you can duplicate an existing preset in the library and customize it.


Once you’re done, the customized preset will appear alongside other pre-installed presets on the selection panel.

Selecting a preset will automatically regenerate the QR code with the selected style and design elements. If you’re using our QR code generator from the API, you can invoke the presets by specifying their names.

Stop re-styling your QR code each time you generate one. Try ScanMeFindMe PRO and use presets instead.
